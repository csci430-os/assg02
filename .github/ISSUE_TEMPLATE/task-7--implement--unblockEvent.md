**Description**

 Implement the `unblockEvent()` simulation function.  You would not need this
for the previous unit test, but now you need to have some way to find out which
process is blocked waiting on a particular `eventId` to occur. 

**Suggested Solution**


**Additional Requirements**


- You are requied to throw a `SimulatorException` if an unblock occurs for an event but no process is currently waiting on that event to occur.
